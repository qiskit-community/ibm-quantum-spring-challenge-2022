# IBM Quantum Spring Challenge 2022

## Introduction

We are proud to welcome you back for another IBM Quantum Challenge!
 
When Richard Feynman proposed quantum computing 41 years ago, he imagined devices which could be used to model the quantum world around us. This year's IBM Quantum Spring Challenge focuses exactly on Professor Feynman's vision, simulating chemistry and many-body systems with four inviting challenges to solve.

The IBM Quantum Spring Challenge runs from **Monday, May 23 at 9AM EDT until Friday, May 27 at 5PM EDT**, and will be divided into two segments. One part will invite participants to tackle problems revolving around many-body systems, while the other will focus on fermionic chemistry simulations. Participants will get a one-of-a-kind opportunity to investigate problems at the forefront of quantum computing research.

To recognize your achievement, those who complete all the exercises will receive a digital achievement badge to showcase the skills you've developed throughout the challenge.
