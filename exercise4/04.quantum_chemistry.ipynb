    "# Exercise 4 - Quantum Chemistry. Electronic Structure Calculations \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computing holds promise to revolutionize high-performance computing and possesses enormous potential for transforming various fields beyond the current capabilities of classical computing. Chemistry is one of the most promising applications of quantum computing. In particular, simulating the electronic structure of molecules to better understand chemical reactions and design new pharmaceutical drugs and materials, is one of the main near-term exciting applications for quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is the main workhorse algorithm for quantum chemistry using near-term quantum computers. It is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that is used to find the ground state energy (lowest energy) of a molecular system. The algorithm was first published in 2014 by Alberto Peruzzo and coworkers [1] and used by IBM Quantum to simulate the ground state energy of small molecules in 2017.[2] Obtaining the ground state energies allows us to understand and study chemical reactions and gain additional insignt into various molecular properties, for instance the exact forces on nuclei than can serve to run molecular dynamics simulations to explore what happens in chemical systems with time.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "VQE algorithm starts with a parameterized quantum circuit called an ansatz and a set of tunable parameters that get iteratively updated with a classical optimizers until the lowest energy is obtained. The VQE's advantage over classical algorithms comes from the fact that a quantum processing unit can represent and store the problem's wavefunction more efficiently than a classical computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum Equation Of Motion (qEOM) algorithm is an extension of the VQE to find the excitation energies (difference between ground and excited states energies, also called electronic transition energies) of the molecule. [4]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will simulate a water molecule using VQE and qEOM to calculate its ground and excited state energies with a variety of tools available in Qiskit Nature.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important tasks when running a VQE algorithm on a noisy quantum computer is to reduce the computational cost by minimizing the quantum resources (number of qubits, quantum gates and measurements). This in turn, minimizes the computational errors. The goal is to construct the most compact and optimal quantum circuit capable of representing the ground state accurately. \n",

    "We will first learn how to define an electronic structure problem with Qiskit Nature. We will then find the most efficient ansatz for approximating the ground state of a water molecule. Finally, we will use the ground state results to perform excited states calculations. \n",

    "Here is the general workflow representing how the molecular simulations using VQE are performed on quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"resources/workflow.png\" width=600/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea behind a hybrid quantum-classical approach is to divide the task between **CPU (classical processing unit)** and **QPU (quantum processing unit)** based on what they can do best. The CPU takes care of listing the terms that need to be measured to compute the energy and also optimizing the circuit parameters. The QPU implements a quantum circuit representing the quantum state of a system and measures the energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, **CPU** can be used to find a set of functions (also called orbitals) which help re-expressing and simplifying the problem. In practice these orbitals are found through the [Hartree–Fock (HF) method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree%E2%80%93Fock_method#:~:text=In%20computational%20physics%20and%20chemistry,system%20in%20a%20stationary%20state.). Further information on this method is provided below. \n",
    "\n",
    "After a HF calculation, the Hamiltonian is expressed in the basis of the resulting orbitals. It is then mapped to a qubit Hamiltonian using fermion-to-qubit transformations (see Hamiltonian section below). One can further analyze the properties of the system to reduce the number of qubits or shorten the ansatz circuit:\n",

You may use the ideas found in those works to find ways to shorten the quantum circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**QPU** is employed to implements quantum circuits (see Ansatzes section below), parameterized by angles $\\vec\\theta$. The goal is to find the set of these angles which best approximate the exact ground state wavefunction (or in other words, that minimizes the energy). Expectation values of different operators can then be measured on the trial wavefucntion prepared in the QPU.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hartree-Fock\n",
    "\n",
    "Hartree-Fock theory is based on the assumption that the many-electron wavefunction of the system can be described by a single Slater determinant made of one-electron molecular orbitals.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Electrons are indistinguishable fermions. This means that any permutation of two electrons must change the sign of the wavefunction (this is a really important constraint called the Pauli exclusion principle, it is the\n",
    "reason for the specific structure of the periodic table).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can always write the electronic wavefunction as the following expansion:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\psi_{\\text{elec}}(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2, ...,\\mathbf{r}_n) = \\sum_{m_1, m_2,...,m_N} C_{m_1, m_2, ..., m_N} | \\phi_{m_1}(\\mathbf{r}_1) \\phi_{m_2}(\\mathbf{r}_2) ... \\phi_{m_n}(\\mathbf{r}_n) |\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C_{m_1, m_2, ..., m_N}$ are complex coefficients, $| \\phi_{m_1}(\\mathbf{r}_1) \\phi_{m_2}(\\mathbf{r}_2) ... \\phi_{m_n}(\\mathbf{r}_n) |$ are Slater determinants and the $\\phi_{m_i}(\\mathbf{r_i})$ are one-electron functions. These one-electron functions are referred to as <b>molecular orbitals (MOs)</b>. MOs are computed with the famous <b>Hartree-Fock (HF)</b> method. Usually they are expanded in terms of <b> atomic orbitals (AOs) </b>:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\phi(\\mathbf{r}, s) = \\sum_n D_{mn}\\chi_n(\\mathbf{r})\\otimes s\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "($s$ is the spin variable $s \\in \\{ \\alpha, \\beta \\}$).\n",
    "The MOs can host two electrons of opposite spin (either spin up ($\\alpha$) or spin down ($\\beta$)) and can either be filled (occupied) or empty (virtual). This spin component of a molecular orbital is also referred to as a spin orbital (SO). When mapping chemistry problems on quantum computers using Jordan-Wigner mapping, one qubit represents one spin orbital.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hartree-Fock method optimizes the coefficients $D_{mn}$ such that the electronic wavefunction expressed as a <b>single Slater determinant</b> ($\\psi_{\\text{elec}}(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2, ...,\\mathbf{r}_n) = | \\phi_{m_1}(\\mathbf{r}_1) \\phi_{m_2}(\\mathbf{r}_2) ... \\phi_{m_n}(\\mathbf{r}_n) |$) minimizes the energy. It often provides a good starting point for more elaborate theoretical methods which are better approximations to the solution of the electronic Schrödinger equation. The Hartree- Fock method determines the set of MOs which minimize the energy and give us this \"best single determinant.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The AOs are functions centered on the atoms. They are themselves expanded in terms of the functions composing the <b> basis set </b>. The basis functions used in quantum chemsitry are taken as sums of Gaussians centered on the atoms times a polynomial function, $P_l$, in the electron coordinates relative to that atom:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\chi_n(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_l N_l^n \\exp\\big( - \\alpha_l^n (|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}_I^n|^2)\\big) P_l(\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}_I^n)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the $\\alpha_l^n$ and of the order of the polynomial determine the <b> basis set </b> (that take different names. Famous ones are: 6-31G, cc-pVQZ, TZ2P...). \n",
    "\n",
    "The basis set (together with the number of particles) determines the total number of AOs. For the same molecule different basis sets lead to different number of AOs and it turn of MOs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The type of basis functions used also influences the accuracy.\n",
    "The better a single basis function is able to reproduce the unknown function, the fewer basis functions necessary for achieving a given level of accuracy. The smaller the basis, the poorer the representation of the MO. \n",

    "### Hamiltonian Mapping \n",
    "\n",
    "For every non-zero matrix element in the $ h_{r s}$ and $g_{p q r s}$ tensors, we can construct corresponding Pauli string (tensor product of Pauli operators) with the following fermion-to-qubit transformation. \n",
    "For instance, in Jordan-Wigner mapping for an orbital $r = 3$, we obtain the following Pauli string:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat a_{3}^{\\dagger}= \\hat \\sigma_z \\otimes \\hat \\sigma_z \\otimes\\left(\\frac{ \\hat \\sigma_x-i \\hat \\sigma_y}{2}\\right) \\otimes 1 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes 1\n",

    "where $\\hat \\sigma_x, \\hat \\sigma_y, \\hat \\sigma_z$ are the well-known Pauli operators. The tensor products of $\\hat \\sigma_z$ operators are placed to enforce the fermionic anti-commutation relations.\n",

    "### Active Space Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For some molecular systems, not all orbitals need to be considered to capture most of the essential chemistry. In fact, we can use our chemical intuition and select a subset of orbitals that play the most important role in determining the energy of our system. This concept is known as an <b>active space</b> selection and it allows us to reduce the size and cost of our quantum chemistry problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "As illustrated in the figure below, instead of simulating all orbitals on a quantum computer (left side) we construct an active space (right side) with some orbitals that are simulated on a quantum computer using VQE (colored in blue), while the rest are approximated using classical methods (colored in yellow).\n",

    "\n",
    "There are mainly 2 types of ansätze you can use for chemical problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **q-UCC ansätze** are physically inspired, and roughly map the electron excitations to quantum circuits. The q-UCCSD ansatz (`UCCSD`in Qiskit) possess all possible single and double electron excitations. The paired double q-pUCCD (`PUCCD`) and singlet q-UCCD0 (`SUCCD`) just consider a subset of such excitations (meaning significantly shorter circuits) and have proved to provide good results for dissociation profiles. For instance, q-pUCCD doesn't have single excitations and the double excitations are paired as in the image below.\n",
    "- **Heuristic ansätze (`TwoLocal`)** were invented to shorten the circuit depth but still be able to represent the ground state. \n",
    "As in the figure below, the R gates represent the parametrized single qubit rotations and $U_{CNOT}$ the entanglers (two-qubit gates). The idea is that after repeating certain $D$-times the same block (with independent parameters) one can reach the ground state. \n",
    "\n",
    "For additional details refer to [Sokolov *et al.* (q-UCC ansatzes)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10864v2) and [Barkoutsos *et al.* (Heuristic ansatzes)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04340.pdf).\n",

    "where $|\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle$ is the trial state associated with $E_{\\theta}$. By applying a parameterized circuit, represented by $U(\\theta)$, to some arbitrary starting state $|\\psi\\rangle$, the algorithm obtains an estimate $U(\\theta)|\\psi\\rangle \\equiv |\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle$ on $|\\psi_{min}\\rangle$. The estimate is iteratively optimized by a classical optimizer by changing the parameter $\\theta$ and minimizing the expectation value of $\\langle \\psi(\\theta) |\\hat H|\\psi(\\theta) \\rangle$. \n",

The more orbitals we include in our active space, the more computationally expensive our quantum circuit will be. As such, the goal is to construct the most accurate activate space with as few orbitals as possible. In Qiskit Nature, we use  `ActiveSpaceTransformer` to specify how many electrons and molecular orbitals we would like to have in our active space, as well as which of those particular orbitals we would like to consider."
